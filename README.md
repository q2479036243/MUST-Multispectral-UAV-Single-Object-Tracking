## Dataset

MUST, a large-scale and challenging dataset for Multispectral UAV Single Object Tracking, has been released.

#### Description:

MUST is the first large-scale and challenging dataset for Multispectral UAV Single Object Tracking, aimed at leveraging the advantages of spectral information to cope with restricted target spatial features. Addressing the data requirements of contemporary deep learning models, this dataset comprises 250 video sequences, totaling 43000 frames. Each frame contains 8 bands covering from visible light to near-infrared bands, with a spatial resolution of up to 1200Ã—900 pixels. Furthermore, the dataset  incorporates 12 key challenge attributes, making it highly representative of real world challenges encountered in practical applications.
